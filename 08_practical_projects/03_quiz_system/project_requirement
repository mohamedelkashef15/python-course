    Create a list of dictionaries containing questions, options (as list), and correct answer

Step 5: Check Answer and Update Score
    Compare selected option with correct answer, print feedback (correct/wrong), increment score if correct

Step 6: Display Final Results
    After loop ends, print final score as "score/total_questions"
