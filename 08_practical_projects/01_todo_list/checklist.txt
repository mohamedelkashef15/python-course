Step 1: Create the Menu Display
    Create a display_menu() function that prints all options (View, Add, Complete, Delete, Exit)

Step 2: Set Up the Main Loop
    Create main() function with a while True loop that displays the menu and gets user input

Step 3: Initialize Task Storage
    Create an empty list tasks = [] to store all tasks as dictionaries

Step 4: Build the View Tasks Feature
    Create view_tasks() function that loops through tasks and displays them with numbers and completion status

Step 5: Build the Add Task Feature
    Create add_task() function that gets user input and appends a new task dictionary to the list

Step 6: Build the Complete Task Feature
    Create complete_task() function that shows tasks, gets task number, and marks it as completed

Step 7: Build the Delete Task Feature
    Create delete_task() function that shows tasks, gets task number, and removes it from the list

Step 8: Connect Menu to Functions
    In main() loop, add if-elif statements to call the right function based on user's menu choice

Step 9: Add Input Validation
    Add try-except blocks to handle invalid numbers and check if task numbers are in valid range

Step 10: Add Exit Functionality
    Handle choice '5' to print "Goodbye!" and break the loop to exit the program
