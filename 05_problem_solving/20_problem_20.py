#############################

# * Problem instructions
# 1- Define a list containing several numbers.
# 2- Use the built-in max() function to find the largest number.

# 4- Print both the maximum and minimum values.

# * Problem solution
numbers = [8, 3, 15, 20, 6]

maximum = max(numbers)
minimum = min(numbers)

print(f"Maximum value: {maximum}")
print(f"Minimum value: {minimum}")
