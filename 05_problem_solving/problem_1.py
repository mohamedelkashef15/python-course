# * Problem definition
# Write a Python program that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.
#############################
# * Problem Instructions
# Instructions
# 1- Read the first number → store it in variable num1.
# 2- Read the second number → store it in variable num2.
# 3- Calculate sum of 2 numbers in third variable called sum_result
# 4- Display result on screen

# * Problem solution
num1= int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2= int(input("Enter second number: "))

sum_result = num1 + num2
print(f"The sum of {num1} + {num2} = {sum_result}")


# * Expected Output
# The sum of 10 + 5 = 15
